<title>MAN PAGES - HOW TO READ MAN PAGES</title>
</head>

<h1>MAN PAGES</h1>

<p>While they're not all well-advertised, there are actually a variety of means of getting
help under Unix. The most important and reliable of these are `<strong>man</strong>'
pages.&nbsp; Man pages correspond to online manuals for programs, file formats, functions,
system calls, and so forth.&nbsp; You might have asked a UNIX question on a newsgroup only
to get back as a reply RTFMP ( Read The "Fantastic" Man Pages ).&nbsp; If you've
never read one before, the best way to start is by typing <strong>'man man</strong>' at
the command line.<br>
<br>
Of course, while <strong>man</strong> pages are a vast improvement over the online
documentation of most other OSes, they suffer from many failings: 

</p><ul>
  <li>some people don't like to read text on the screen </li>
  <li>not very helpful unless you already know what to look for </li>
  <li>not always accessible even when present </li>
  <li>not always present, especially under Linux </li>
  <li>frequently hard to read, as they try to be authoritative (and are therefore often too
    technical for new users) </li>
  <li>frequently out of date </li>
</ul>

<p>That said, they're still better and more comprehensive than the alternatives. We'll try
to address the first three failings in this document. </p>

<h2><a name="HTRMP">HOW TO READ MAN PAGES</a></h2>

<p>Man pages are the standard documentation for every Unix; you're sure to come across a
reference before too long of the form: </p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">&lt;command&gt;(N) </font></p>

<p>Where N is a number from 1-9, possibly followed by a letter.&nbsp; Here's an example
we'll pick apart ( note: this example does not apply to all UNIX's but should be taken as
general form )</p>

<pre><font color="#0000FF">% man mkdir

MKDIR(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USER COMMANDS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MKDIR(1)

NAME
&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir - make a directory

SYNOPSIS
&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir [ -p ] dirname...

DESCRIPTION
&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir creates directories. Standard entries,`.',for the
&nbsp;&nbsp; directory itself, and `..' for its parent, are made automat-
&nbsp;&nbsp; ically.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The -p flag allows missing parent directories
&nbsp;&nbsp; to be created as needed.

&nbsp;&nbsp; With the exception of the set-gid bit, the
&nbsp;&nbsp; current umask(2V) setting determines the mode in which
&nbsp;&nbsp; directories are created. The new directory inherits the set-gid
&nbsp;&nbsp; bit of the parent directory. Modes may be modified after
&nbsp;&nbsp; creation by using chmod(1V).

&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir requires write permission in the parent directory.

SEE ALSO
&nbsp;&nbsp; chmod(1V), rm(1), mkdir(2v), umask(2V)</font>
  </pre>

<p>Here's the breakdown of our example. </p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">MKDIR(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USER COMMANDS
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MKDIR(1)</font>&nbsp; </p>

<p>This means that the <font color="#0000FF"><strong>MKDIR</strong></font> command is
documented under that name, in section <font color="#0000FF">(1)</font> given within
parentheses. <br>
<br>
The section may be necessary in case there are multiple man pages for the same name. In
the example above there are man pages called <strong>'mkdir'</strong> in both sections <font color="#0000FF"><strong>(1</strong>)</font> and <font color="#0000FF">(2v)</font>. If
unspecified, <strong>man</strong> will give you the first manpage it finds. The <strong>-f</strong>
option will show you all the available <strong>man</strong> pages for a given name.&nbsp;
The same effect can be achieved by using the command <strong><font color="#000000">whatis</font></strong>
instead of man<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">%whatis mkdir</font></p>

<p><strong>AND</strong></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">%man -f mkdir</font></p>

<p>are synonymous.&nbsp; You should be able to get a description of each section (they
vary from Unix to Unix) by doing </p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">%man SECTION# intro</font></p>

<p>Continuing with the breakdown of the <strong>mkdir</strong> man page.</p>

<pre><font color="#0000FF">NAME
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir - make a directory</font>    </pre>

<p>The name of the command and a brief description.</p>

<pre><font color="#0000FF">SYNOPSIS
    &nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir [ -p ] dirname...</font>    </pre>

<p>This discribes the various flags and the proper format the command requires.&nbsp; The
flag in this instance is <strong>-p</strong> and the syntax requires a directory name to
follow. ( note: most flags are optional )&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<pre><font color="#0000FF">DESCRIPTION
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir creates directories. Standard entries,`.', for the

<h2><a name="FMP">FINDING MAN PAGES</a></h2>

<p><font color="#0000FF">apropos / man -k / man -kr<br>
</font><br>
One invocation of man that you'll likely come to be very familiar with is the <strong>man
-k</strong> (keyword) option. This function is also available by<br>
running <strong>apropos</strong> (1), i.e. <strong>man -k</strong> and <strong>apropos</strong>
are equivalent. It lets you search the database of man page summaries to look for a
keyword<br>
that might be mentionned in them. </p>

<p>Suppose we were looking for utilities to manipulate postscript documents.&nbsp; We
would either do<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">%man -k postscript</font></p>

<p><strong>or</strong></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">%apropos postscript</font></p>

<p>This produces a list, with summaries, of man pages which are likely to be related to
your topic.&nbsp; If you were looking for something less specific, say programs associated
with databases, you would probably want to use less and/or grep to filter and view the
output.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">%man -k postscript | less</font></p>

<p>The output may produce many screens of data.</p>

<p>Note, these commands search the database which in most cases must be built by the
system administrators, a task which is sometimes forgotten.&nbsp; If you can't find what
you are looking for and you believe it's there, try doing </p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">%man -u man</font></p>

<p>under Linux followed by your search, or</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">%man -F</font></p>

<p>under Solaris.&nbsp; SunOS has no such option.&nbsp; Before trying this, make sure your
MANPATH variable is set correctly.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="MP">MANPATH</a></h2>

<p>There can be several hierarchies of man pages, depending on the system. On most of our
systems, at least the following directories exist: /usr/man, /usr/local/man. In addition,
there will be one for X programs (/usr/X11/man, /usr/local/X11/man, or /usr/openwin/man)
and likely one for SOCS-specific man pages (/usr/socs/man). <br>
<br>
<strong>man</strong> searches the environment variable <strong>MANPATH</strong> (a
colon-seperated list of directories like the PATH variable) for man pages.&nbsp; If you
have hacked your script files or staff screwed up, the MANPATH could be wrong. The command
<strong>whereis</strong> may be able to help here. <strong>whereis</strong> will locate
the binary, source and manual page files for a command.&nbsp; For example: ( note: this
specific example should not be taken as generic under Unix but only as a illustration of
possible results )</p>
<font color="#0000FF">

</font><p><font color="#0000FF">%whereis man</font><br>
<font color="#0000FF">man: /usr/ucb/man /usr/local/man /usr/man/man1/man.1
/usr/man/man7/man.7 </font><br>
</p>

<h2><a name="MSFM">MANUAL SEARCH FOR MAN</a></h2>

<p>Alternatively, you can just try the quick-and-dirty method of running <strong>grep</strong>
(1) in the man directories you think might contain the command you are looking for; note
that man pages are not stored in plain text format so the output may not be always
readable. If you find the string you are looking for in a file located in MANDIR/man#, do </p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">%man -M MANDIR # filename</font><br>
<br>
to view the corresponding man page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="TNMPFX">THERE'S NO MAN PAGE FOR X!</a></h2>

<p>Ok, you have tried the suggestions given above to locate man pages, and still have not
had any luck. It's quite possible there is no man page corresponding to what you're
looking for - either because the tool or functionality you're searching for isn't
installed on the system or because it has no man page installed (the latter is far more
common under Linux than elsewhere). <br>
<br>
Let's suppose that you're especially determined because you <strong>"know"</strong>
that the command exists - it does something, just not quite what you want. Rather than get
irate at the undocumented command, first make sure that it is actually a program that
deserves a man page; here's an algorithmic approach to looking for a command's help file.<br>
<br>
If you're running <strong>ksh</strong> or <strong>bash</strong> (you'll know if you are),
first do<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">%type -t CMD</font><br>
<br>
For any other shell, do<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">%which CMD</font><br>
<br>
This will tell you what kind of command you're dealing with. <br>
<br>
If it says CMD is a <strong>'builtin'</strong>, then do <b>'help CMD'</b> (bash only) or
read your shell's manual page. ~(Note that tcsh - except under Linux - doesn't document
all of its builtins since most are identical to csh's; I suggest looking in csh's man page
first if you are somewhere other than Linux-land.)~<br>
<br>
If you're told that CMD is an 'alias', then do<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">%alias CMD</font><br>
<br>
and repeat this procedure from the beginning with the first word that alias returns. If
you are told that CMD is a function ( not in csh ), do <br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">%typeset -f CMD</font><br>
<br>
to see its definition; from there you are on your own.<br>
<br>
If you are given a path, then you may be justified in being irate. Or maybe the
documentation is in another format; keep reading.</p>

<h2><a name="PMP">PRINTING MAN PAGES</a></h2>

<p>You have a couple of options here, depending on whether you mind wasting a full page of
paper for each page of text. We recommend printing man pages at least half-size, as you're
unlikely to return to them a month later.<br>
<br>
The simplest thing and most portable to do (though alternatives exist) is <br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">%man -t MANPAGE &gt; Manpage.ps </font></p>

<p>( Note: only works unaided under Linux )</p>

<p>This will produce a file called Manpage.ps in your current directory, which you can
then use <strong>psnup</strong> (1) under SunOS to print 2- or 4- pages to a physical
page. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, while the <strong>-t</strong> parameter is itself portable to virtually all
man implementations, the output is not.&nbsp; Under Linux, the above works fine. Under
SunOS and Solaris, you have to do some preparation first: define the environment variable <strong>TCAT</strong>
to be 'cat' and <strong>TROFF</strong> to be '/usr/local/bin/groff -man'. Furthermore, the
<strong>GROFF_TYPESETTER</strong> variable must be set to 'ps'.<br>
<br>
If you have trouble getting psnup to work or don't feel like fooling around with it, you
can always work with text instead. This isn't ~quite~ text, as it still has bolding and
underlining and so forth, but <strong>a2ps(1)</strong> understands it, as does <strong>less(1)</strong>.<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">%man MANPAGE|a2ps -m &gt;MANPAGE.ps</font><br>
<br>
You don't have to produce the ps file if you don't like, of course - if you're confident
that it'll work the first time, replace the '&gt;MANPAGE.ps' with '|lpr -Pprinter-name'.
Personally, I recommend previewing the output with <strong>ghostview</strong> (1)
beforehand.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">&nbsp;</font></p>

<h2><a name="DYRWM">DO YOU REALLY WANT MAN?</a></h2>

<p>Not all documentation is located in the manpages. The shells sometimes have online
help, as do various other programs, especially graphical ones. </p>

<p>Other major online help systems include:</p>

<h3><font color="#000000">INFO</font></h3>

<p><br>
Info isn't really complex enough to deserve describing in detail. In brief, you can read
info pages within <strong>emacs</strong> using <strong>'C-h i'</strong> ('info') or from
the command line using the command </p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">% info</font></p>

<p>Online help and a tutorial on the info system are available from within both
interfaces.&nbsp; Don't discount info pages; although they are used mainly by GNU
software, this includes such hugely useful info pages as <strong>gdb</strong>, <strong>gcc</strong>,
<strong>emacs</strong>, <strong>gawk</strong>, and <strong>make</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>Perl</strong>
and bash also have info pages, though the information is available by other means as well
in their cases.</p>

<h3>/usr/doc</h3>

<p>Only available under Linux, and often not terribly interesting, as a well-behaved
package will provide documentation that can be integrated with the major help systems.
&nbsp; Still, there is a lot there, and should definitely be considered if you cannot find
what you are looking for elsewhere.&nbsp; Of particular interest are the docs for xv,
debian, vim, wget, pqp, pine, libq++ and hsc.</p>

<p>Files contained here will generally be of three types: HTML, postscript, or plan text (
ASCII ).&nbsp; We will make the assumption that you know how to deal with these formats.
&nbsp; Use the information in this document to find help and read up on <strong>lynx(1)</strong>,
<strong>ghostview(1)</strong>, and<strong> less(1)</strong></p>

<h3>/use/local/pkgs, /usr/local/doc, /usr/share, /usr/local/share</h3>

<p>These are more common to the servers, though they may exist on Linux machines as well.
&nbsp; Software packages are commonly installed into </p>

<p><strong>/usr/local/pkgs/PKGNAME-VER#</strong></p>

<p>and a link to that directory is created as</p>

<p><strong>/usr/local/pkgs/PKGNAME</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes there is documentation to be found there.&nbsp; Documentation which is
located in <strong>/usr/doc/PKGNAME</strong> on Linux will be in these directories on the
servers, though they may get linked or copied into the other directories mentionned above
( <strong>/usr/local/doc</strong>, <strong>/usr/share</strong>, <strong>/usr/local/share</strong>
)</p>

<h3>Perldoc</h3>

<p>Much Perl documentation is embedded with the source modules themselves.&nbsp; To access
it, you can usually do</p>

<p><strong>%perldoc MODULENAME</strong></p>

<p>and a man page will be generated for you.</p>

<h3>Source code and Include files</h3>

<p>While it should probably be a last resort, the source <strong>IS</strong> always the
most current and sometimes the only documentation available for a particular package.
&nbsp; This is usually not installed on the system unless it cannot be compiled:&nbsp; For
example, Perl scripts and Lisp source are both interpreted, and so the program is the
source. Whether or not the program you are trying to learn more about is written in a
compiled or interpreted language./usr/include and /usr/local/include may have very useful
files to help. </p>
